      <h2>Educational Background</h2>
      <h5>Date: Friday, September 16, 2023.</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg"><img src="./education.png" alt="school boy" width="100%"></div>
      <p>
        I've had the privilege of pursuing a diverse educational background that has shaped me into a well-rounded professional with a broad skill set and deep knowledge in various fields.
      
        My educational journey began in 2004 when I embarked on a journey into <b>Software Engineering at NIIT</b>. During this time, I honed my technical skills, delving into computer science and programming, which laid a solid foundation for my future endeavors in the digital realm.
        </p>  
        In 2012, I expanded my horizons by pursuing a <b>Bachelors degree in Public Administration</b> at the University of Abuja. This experience provided me with insights into the intricate workings of government, public policy formulation, and effective organizational management within the public sector. I also gained a strong understanding of ethical considerations, accountability, and the principles of good governance. Building upon my public administration knowledge, I decided to further specialize by studying <b>Electronic Records Management at the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria (ASCON), Badagry</b> in 2018. This field allowed me to merge my technical skills with my administrative acumen, equipping me with the expertise to efficiently organize, preserve, and manage electronic data while ensuring its security.
        </p>
        <p>
        My educational background uniquely positions me as a professional who can bridge the gap between technology, public administration, and data management. I am well-prepared for roles that demand a combination of technical proficiency and administrative insight. Whether it's IT project management, government IT consulting, or roles related to data governance and compliance, I am equipped to excel and make a meaningful impact in these dynamic fields.</p>
